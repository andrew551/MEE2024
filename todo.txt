High priority:
* input fixed platescale and distortion coefficients
	** fix cubic but allow linear degrees of freedom

Medium priority:
* (later): specialised routine for platesolving eclipse data, using stars at edges of image.
	** compute radial deflection as function of distance to sun
* compare centroid finding function with Astrometrica. Astrometrica might be better at finding centroids of very dim stars

Low priority:
* currently light deflection correction is always off, would an option to turn it back on be useful?
