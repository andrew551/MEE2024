High priority:
* input fixed platescale and distortion coefficients
	** fix cubic but allow linear degrees of freedom

Medium priority:
* use local coordinates, pressure, and temperature to apply refraction correction
	** https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmospheric_refraction#:~:text=Atmospheric%20refraction%20is%20the%20deviation,as%20a%20function%20of%20height.
	** user provides observation altitude angle (I guess)
* (later): specialised routine for platesolving eclipse data, using stars at edges of image.
	** compute radial deflection as function of distance to sun
* compare centroid finding function with Astrometrica. Astrometrica might be better at finding centroids of very dim stars

Low priority:
* correction for parallax, relativistic aberration: instruments have not reached a sensitivity level where these are significant yet
