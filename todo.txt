Medium priority:
* (later): specialised routine for platesolving eclipse data, using stars at edges of image.
	** compute radial deflection as function of distance to sun
* compare centroid finding function with Astrometrica. Astrometrica might be better at finding centroids of very dim stars

* offline gaia mode (download large file once)

Low priority:
	
* display star names / IDs
